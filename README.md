## Bank Customer Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict whether a bank customer is likely to leave or stay with the bank. 
The model is been trained with historical customer data, including their demographics, transactional behavior, and other relevant features like age, job, marital, education, housing, loan, contact...
The aim is to develop an accurate prediction model that can help the bank identify and retain customers who are at risk of leaving, thereby improving customer satisfaction and reducing customer churn. 
This project requires expertise in data analysis, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization to effectively communicate the results.
